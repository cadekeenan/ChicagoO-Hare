## Intro
Flying is something that millions of people do every day. For some people, it is a hectic and 
nerve-wracking experience to get through the airport while hoping your flight will not be delayed or 
canceled. We want to make this experience a little easier for people by providing some data showing 
statistics to help calm people's nerves about flying. After looking at our data, you will be able to choose 
an airline and day that is statistically better to fly on, which means there is a higher chance that your 
flight will not be delayed or canceled and that everything will go smoothly. We will focus on the Chicago 
O’Hare International airport in Chicago, IL because that is one of the largest airports in the country, and 
the biggest airport in the Midwest. Many people from the University of Iowa use this airport and we are 
hoping to provide a resource to aid in deciding what the ideal travel plans are when flying through this 
airport.

## Data Summary
This project uses data from the 2015 Kaggle data gathered on Commercial Air Flight Delays. 

Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, destination airport, and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times. Data from this Kaggle set comes from over 5 million commercial flights disclosing the data to the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. We had to significantly cut down the data in order to be able to manipulate it and transform it into usable data for analysis. We have limited our data to only looking at the Chicago O’Hare airport. 

### Frequent fliers of O’Hare can benefit from our analysis.

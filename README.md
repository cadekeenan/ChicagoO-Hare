# ChicagoO-Hare
This project uses data from the 2015 Kaggle data gathered on Commercial Air Flight Delays. 

Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, destination airport, and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times. Data from this Kaggle set comes from over 5 million commercial flights disclosing the data to the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. We had to significantly cut down the data in order to be able to manipulate it and transform it into usable data for analysis. We have limited our data to only looking at the Chicago O’Hare airport. 

Frequent fliers of O’Hare can benefit from our analysis.
